# [Untitled Math Trainer v0.3](https://dkallen78.github.io/math-trainer/v0.3/quickMath.html)

## Update 2024-01-26

### 22:30

Filled in the operation micro skills. Fundementals has 8, Reorder 8, Place Value 6, Partition 8, and Compensation 4. Eventually I'll be filling those out more but I want to move on to something else next. I might work on fleshing out subtraction or starting on multiplication but I might just rename "Progression" from the top-level menu to "Survival" and work on that. I need to change things up a bit I think. 

### 15:00

I have revamped the problem tester! It's a lot prettier now and it's easier to see what's going on. I think there's more that I need to do with it, but for the moment, I'm very pleased.

### 00:00

I powered through a few more micro skills (three in Addition-Place Value) but I got hung up on trying to consolidate some of the *seemingly* redundant functions. It turns out I'm not as clever as I thought so I kept things mostly as they were. 

Then I thought I'd start on remaking the problem tester program. I never liked how it didn't keep track of the answers produced, only the percentages involved so I started redoing it with a mind to keep ahold of those values. I think it's going to be mostly the same but I'm going to go back at it with an eye for style once I get it doing what I want.

But it's midnight now and I don't want to be too grumpy in the morning so it's time to turn it in.

### Issues

* Investigate poppy phone sound (low priority for now)

* Do something about `addWithin()` function

## Purpose

Working as a substitute teacher I saw an unmet need for mental math skills. There is a lot of good work being done on number fluency which is a foundational math skill, but mental 
math and automaticity have received a bad name due to how tedious memorizing the multiplication tables can be. I'm trying to make a tool (not a game) for developing those skills 
incorporating elements of game design and based on rigorous academic research into learning and mathematics. It's not flashy by design so as to foster an appreciation of math on an 
intrinsic level.

## Lines of Investigation

### [Compulsion Loops](https://dkallen78.github.io/math-trainer/blob/main/research/compulsionLoops.md)

### [Behavioral Psychology](https://dkallen78.github.io/math-trainer/blob/main/research/behavioralPsych.md)

### Emotional Induction

### Color

I set out to make this program sparse. I had gone with the game aesthetic in the Mathemagicus game and I wanted this to be more utilitarian. But there is research that indicates that color is almost universally preferred to black and white. I still want to maintain the "clean" aesthetic of the program as it stands now, but I think it could benefit from limited color. One question is where and how to use it. Another is which colors to use. Pett & Wilson (1996, it's on JSTOR) mention that it can be used to draw attention to something, which I think would work really well in an otherwise color-sparse environment. They also mention that humans in general are really good at using colors for identifying things (like resistors). Maybe I could use color to subtly indicate which skill is being shown?

I think it's important to acknowledge that, according to [Castell et al (2018)](https://dkallen78.github.io/math-trainer/Refs/Castell-et-al-2018.pdf) there doesn't seem to be an inherent connection between a specific color and either cognitive performance or emotional state. I had pondered using a pulse of green for correct answers and a pulse of red for a wrong one, but it might be better to let the user pick their preferred color for correct input and its color complement for incorrect input.

### Historical Research

I'm reading through some 19th century articles right now and it's striking how passionate
the writers are in their advocacy for mental math. I feel like these advocates are
the source for the timed multiplication table tests I had to take in the 4th grade.
Although none of the authors I've read so far have called for timed testing, their
means for improving mental calculation are left unsaid.

> Apparently the timed tests to which I (and many others) was subjected were not a
direct result of the 19th century educational fad of mental math. Many schools switched
to a program of oral math. There was a backlash to this that lasted until the middle
of the 20th century when there was a revival in interest. And here we are again.
"Everything old is new again."

The exception is [Haskins, (1887)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44464091) who gives
examples that would be familiar to teachers today, such as counting by 2s up and down
the number line.
