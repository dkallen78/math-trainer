The sound options menu is coming together! Yesterday my scales were janky, today they're still janky, but not as bad. I also put together a way to change keys. I made some compromises there but if I hadn't, my code would have been kind of ugly and I like to avoid that when I can. Aside from the compromises, I'm really happy with how it turned out on the page and under the hood. I think I'm going to try playing with changing the waveforms next which should be straight forward for the basic waves but if I want to do anything fancy, it will get hard real quick. I'm also pondering just loading this thing up with all kinds of musical scales just for funsies and see if I can't find a good UI to make it work.

I also started adding stuff to my GitHub kanban so hopefully I can use that to keep on top of things.

### Issues

* Sound is still "crunchy" on my phone. I don't know if it's my speakers or just the tones causing weird issues.

## Purpose

Working as a substitute teacher I saw an unmet need for mental math skills. There is a lot of good work being done on number fluency which is a foundational math skill, but mental 
math and automaticity have received a bad name due to how tedious memorizing the multiplication tables can be. I'm trying to make a tool (not a game) for developing those skills 
incorporating elements of game design and based on rigorous academic research into learning and mathematics. It's not flashy by design so as to foster an appreciation of math on an 
intrinsic level.

### Emotional Induction

### Color

I set out to make this program sparse. I had gone with the game aesthetic in the Mathemagicus game and I wanted this to be more utilitarian. But there is research that indicates that color is almost universally preferred to black and white. I still want to maintain the "clean" aesthetic of the program as it stands now, but I think it could benefit from limited color. One question is where and how to use it. Another is which colors to use. Pett & Wilson (1996, it's on JSTOR) mention that it can be used to draw attention to something, which I think would work really well in an otherwise color-sparse environment. They also mention that humans in general are really good at using colors for identifying things (like resistors). Maybe I could use color to subtly indicate which skill is being shown?

I think it's important to acknowledge that, according to [Castell et al (2018)](https://dkallen78.github.io/math-trainer/Refs/Castell-et-al-2018.pdf) there doesn't seem to be an inherent connection between a specific color and either cognitive performance or emotional state. I had pondered using a pulse of green for correct answers and a pulse of red for a wrong one, but it might be better to let the user pick their preferred color for correct input and its color complement for incorrect input.

### Historical Research

I'm reading through some 19th century articles right now and it's striking how passionate
the writers are in their advocacy for mental math. I feel like these advocates are
the source for the timed multiplication table tests I had to take in the 4th grade.
Although none of the authors I've read so far have called for timed testing, their
means for improving mental calculation are left unsaid.

> Apparently the timed tests to which I (and many others) was subjected were not a
direct result of the 19th century educational fad of mental math. Many schools switched
to a program of oral math. There was a backlash to this that lasted until the middle
of the 20th century when there was a revival in interest. And here we are again.
"Everything old is new again."

The exception is [Haskins, (1887)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44464091) who gives
examples that would be familiar to teachers today, such as counting by 2s up and down
the number line.
