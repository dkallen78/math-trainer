# [Untitled Math Trainer](https://dkallen78.github.io/math-trainer/quickMath.html)

## Purpose

To create a free platform for practicing and developing arithmetical skills.

## Current State of the Program

At the moment it has a rough functionality. There is a title screen (super important =P),
a level select menu, and the ability to practice three levels of mental math skills.

## Things to Add

- [ ] Ability to change color palettes

- [x] Button feedback

- [ ] Keyboard interface

- [ ] Desktop layout (in progress)

- [ ] Determine best method of assessment

- [ ] Keep track of user data

- [ ] Different modes

## Lines of Investigation

### Timed versus Untimed Assessment

I'm looking at the effects of timed assessment on mathematical performance. Most research
indicates (unsurprisingly) that students perform worse on timed assessments rather
than untimed ones, but I was surprised to read one study ([Tsui & Mazzocco, 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2806671/)) that found a negative
correlation between math anxiety and the difference in performance between timed and
untimed tests. In other words, in this study, students with more math anxiety performed
better at the timed tests than the students w/ less anxiety. The caveat to this factoid
is there were only 30 students involved in the analysis.

It's interesting to note that this study gave all student participants a timed and
untimed test. Students scored lower on the timed test only when it was administered
before the untimed test. In other words, if you want to mitigate the negative performance
results of timed tests, you should administer it after an untimed one. The researchers
attribute this effect to practice and familiarity ameliorating the negative effect.
