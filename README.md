# [Untitled Math Trainer](https://dkallen78.github.io/math-trainer/quickMath.html)

## Purpose

To create a free platform for practicing and developing arithmetical skills.

## Current State of the Program

At the moment it has a rough functionality. There is a title screen (super important =P),
a level select menu, and the ability to practice three levels of mental math skills.

## Things to Add

- [ ] Ability to change color palettes

- [x] Button feedback

- [ ] Keyboard interface

- [ ] Desktop layout (in progress)

- [ ] Determine best method of assessment

- [ ] Keep track of user data

- [ ] Different modes

## Lines of Investigation

### Timed versus Untimed Assessment

Most research indicates (unsurprisingly) that students perform worse on timed assessments
rather than untimed ones, but I was surprised to read one study ([Tsui & Mazzocco, 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2806671/)) that found a negative
correlation between math anxiety and the difference in performance between timed and
untimed tests. In other words, in this study, students with more math anxiety performed
better at the timed tests than the students w/ less anxiety. The caveat to this factoid
is there were only 30 students involved in the analysis.

It's interesting to note that this study gave all student participants a timed and
untimed test. Students scored lower on the timed test only when it was administered
before the untimed test. In other words, if you want to mitigate the negative performance
results of timed tests, you should administer it after an untimed one. The researchers
attribute this effect to practice and familiarity ameliorating the negative effect.

Pearson did a study ([Pearson, 2004](http://images.pearsonassessments.com/images/tmrs/tmrs_rg/TimedUntimed.pdf)) that looked at timed versus untimed administrations of the Stanford
10 test and (despite their interest in timed tests) found mixed results. They found
that an untimed test was a benefit to students with disabilities and primary school
students but also that secondary school students who took an untimed test performed
worse.



### Effect of Math Anxiety on Performance

Despite what [Tsui & Mazzocco (2007)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2806671/)
found in the study mentioned above (the study was conducted on a group of mathematically
gifted 6th graders), in general students with higher levels of math anxiety performed
poorer on assessments than their less anxious counterparts. According to [Ashcraft & Kirk (2001)](https://www.academia.edu/download/27137080/xge1302224.pdf) this anxiety doesn't manifest
with simple arithmetic operations (ie, operations involving single digits), rather
it manifests with relatively more complex operations like those between two 2-digit
numbers, especially when "carrying" is involved in the operation.

Ashcraft & Kirk also theorize that working memory is a major contributor to arithmetic
performance and that math anxiety acts as a detriment to working memory, leading to
the observed declines in performance. The idea is that harboring an anxiety over a
math problem takes up one of the items in our working memory, rendering our mental
computations less efficient.

> This suggests to me the importance of automaticity in math education. High levels
of automaticity would decrease the student's working memory load.

They note that math anxiety tends to be a self-perpetuating phenomenon. Anxiety leads
to worse performance which leads to increased anxiety which deteriorates performance
further. They also note that students with math anxiety tend to not only perform
worse on arithmetic assessments, but they are less likely to engage in mathematics
later on in their academic careers (eg, high school and university course work, and
STEM careers), performing worse in those endeavors when they do.

One thing to keep in mind with math anxiety is that it has no relationship to intelligence.
According to [Ashcraft (2002)](www.mccc.edu/~jenningh/Courses/documents/math_anxiety.pdf)
the small correlation that does exist (r = -.17) is likely due to questions involving
quantitative processes on the IQ test.

Another interesting finding of this review was that the negative performance associated
with math anxiety primarily manifests with more complicated problems such as those
involving "mixed fractions, percentages, equations with unknowns, and factoring."

#### How to Reduce Math Anxiety

One of the most effective methods of reducing math anxiety is a technique called
systemic desensitization, or graduated exposure therapy ([Hembree, 1990](https://www.jstor.org/stable/749455)). Hembree doesn't go into the details of how this was applied, however.
