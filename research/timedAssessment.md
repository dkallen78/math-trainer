## Timed versus Untimed Assessment

Most research indicates (unsurprisingly) that students perform worse on timed assessments
rather than untimed ones, but I was surprised to read one study ([Tsui & Mazzocco, 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2806671/)) that found a negative
correlation between math anxiety and the difference in performance between timed and
untimed tests. In other words, in this study, students with more math anxiety performed
better at the timed tests than the students w/ less anxiety. The caveat to this factoid
is there were only 30 students involved in the analysis.

It's interesting to note that this study gave all student participants a timed and
untimed test. Students scored lower on the timed test only when it was administered
before the untimed test. In other words, if you want to mitigate the negative performance
results of timed tests, you should administer it after an untimed one. The researchers
attribute this effect to practice and familiarity ameliorating the negative effect.

Pearson did a study ([Pearson, 2004](http://images.pearsonassessments.com/images/tmrs/tmrs_rg/TimedUntimed.pdf)) that looked at timed versus untimed administrations of the Stanford
10 test and (despite their interest in timed tests) found mixed results. They found
that an untimed test was a benefit to students with disabilities and primary school
students but also that secondary school students who took an untimed test performed
worse.

> It's pretty clear that untimed assessments are the way to go for most math. I'm
wondering now if having a countdown before the math problems start conjures a shadow
of that anxiety. Alternatively, I put it in because I wanted a predictable ease in
to the problems.

> A line of argument I see a lot is that students need to be exposed to timed tests
because it prepares them for high-stakes tests in the future (eg, SAT and ACT). Although
I believe there is some merit to that sentiment, I don't think the overt use of a
timer has a place in the core functionality of this program.
