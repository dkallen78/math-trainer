## Behavioral Psychology

From [John Hopson (2001)](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/behavioral-game-design),
in Gamasutra:

* Reinforcer: a reward to be given

* Contingency: the conditions for receiving the reward

* Response: what the user/subject does to achieve the contingency

The response I want is for my users to continue practicing math. The only rewards I have to offer are either achievements or intrinsic rewards. My contingencies are many. I want to reward every correct answer. I want to reward achievement of mastery of a skill. I want to reward near answers in some cases.

The other piece of behavioral psychology that Hopson talks about is intervals and ratios. These are the spaces between the rewards, the contingencies. Intervals are gaps of time between rewards and ratios are number of tasks between rewards.

Intervals work at motivating behavior but not consistent behavior. Users wait until the reward is imminent to engage with the desired behavior and find something else to do until then.

A fixed ratio system can work but there can be task avoidance to start the process to achieve the fixed number of tasks. The most consistent in producing the desired behavior is a variable ratio system where the user doesn't know precisely when they will be rewarded.
