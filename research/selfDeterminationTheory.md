## Self-Determination Theory (SDT)

From the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory):

SDT is a theory of motivation that grew out of studies studying extrinsic and intrinsic
motivations. SDT posits that intrinsic motives are the primary psychological motivations
in all individuals.

* Intrinsic motives are internal rewards; things that are done for the pleasure of
doing them.

* Extrinsic motives are outside rewards that motivate our behavior.

SDT says that there are three basic psychological needs that inform our intrinsic
motivation:

1. **Autonomy.** Self determination. Agency. To be in control of one's own life.
Psychological liberty. Freedom of internal will. Deadlines are a restriction of autonomy
because they remove control from the individual, reducing their intrinsic motivation.
Choice (and the illusion of it?) increases one's sense of autonomy.

2. **Competence.** A *feeling* of mastery. This is where positive feedback comes into
play. Praising someone for accomplishing a task increases their feelings of competence
which feeds their intrinsic motivation.

3. **Relatedness.** Connection to others. Desire to interact with others.
