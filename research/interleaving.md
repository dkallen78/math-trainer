## Interleaving

 According to [Ostrow, et al (2015)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Neil-Heffernan/publication/300790208_Blocking_Vs_Interleaving_Examining_Single-Session_Effects_Within_Middle_School_Math_Homework/links/5e36ff61458515072d7a0301/Blocking-Vs-Interleaving-Examining-Single-Session-Effects-Within-Middle-School-Math-Homework.pdf),  interleaving (the practice of switching topics of study throughout a practice session)  has a significant positive effect on learning outcomes in mathematics practice. Their study specifically focused on 7th grade math students. Students were divided into two groups. One group took a 12 question practice assignment with the types of problems mixed up. Another group took the same practice assignment with the problems organized by type. Later they were given a 3-question follow up assessment to determine how effective the practice assignment was.

 The study (which was a replication of a previous study) found that among high-skilled students there was little positive effect of interleaving but there was a significant
 benefit for the low-skilled students.

 * I was questioning whether it was better to present problems by subject or randomly. This leads me to believe that random problems are better and would benefit a greater number of users.

 [Foster, et al (2019)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-019-00918-4) looked at whether interleaving was more effective with multiple problems of a similar type or with more dissimilar problems. Their findings support the distributed-practice hypothesis which says the beneficial effect of interleaving is due to spaced repetition of the problems, that is, giving the learner time between types of problems
