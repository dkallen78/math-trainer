## How to Train Working Memory (WM)?

Based on the number of pop science articles on improving WM and the dearth of academic articles on the subject it seems like there isn't a reliable way to improve working memory. [Clark, et al (2017)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5448748/) found that after 6 weeks of WM training, participants got better at the WM tasks but there wasn't a "transfer" to other abilities (eg, arithmetic), nor was there an increase in WM capacity. The caveat to this study is that it was conducted on adults aged 18-40 and the authors acknowledge the lack of scientific consensus on the utility of WM training.

In [Nelson Cowan's (2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207727/) review of the history and current state of WM, he points out that there are different aspects of WM:

* Capacity, or how many items can be stored

* Speed, how quickly they can be recalled

* Knowledge, or familiarity with the subject matter

* Strategies, methods of chunking items into one WM slot

This could shed light on the findings of Clark's team that WM training doesn't transfer, possibly because familiarity with a task or subject is needed to augment WM.
